/*                               WHERE CLAUSE
    ðŸ”¸ Multiple table selection is possible by chaining ( with a comma )
    the `FROM` clause with the tables names combined to their respective
    table alias.

    ðŸ”¸ Regarding the columns to select: it should be declared with a dot 
    notation <TABLE ALIAS>.<COLUMN FIELD> for each fields required
    
    ðŸ”¸ `WHERE` clause will check for the primary_key equality ( field in common 
    between both table ) - ðŸ“Œ this avoids the query to assign values and make 
    duplicates

    This is commonly known as a basic approach to "join" the tables
    ( cf keyword JOIN that can do that : better practice ) 


    ```
        SELECT <TABLE_ALIAS_1>.<COLUMN>,  <TABLE_ALIAS_2>.<COLUMN>
        FROM <TABLE_1> AS <TABLE_ALIAS_1>, <TABLE_2> AS <TABLE_ALIAS_2>
        WHERE <COLUMN_PRIM_KEY> = <COLUMN_FOREIGN_KEY>
    ```

    is recommanded

    This is the better approach to "join" the tables
