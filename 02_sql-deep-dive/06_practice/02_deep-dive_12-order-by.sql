/*
    ðŸ”¸ `ORDER BY` clause allows to sort data based on a criteria.
    
    ðŸ”¸ The criteria is a column name and optional [ ASC/ DESC ] order
        - ASC: ascendant
        - DESC: descendant
        
    ðŸ”¸ When ORDER BY is applied on multiple columns and has an optional
    order criteria [ ASC/DESC ] - this is applied to the right most column
    
    ðŸ”¸ ORDER BY can be used with expression ( using built in function )

*/


-- Example: Is the order applied to all columns or else?
SELECT * FROM employees
ORDER BY first_name, last_name DESC; -- DESC is applied to last_name only


-- Example: Each column can apply an order option [ ASC/DESC ]
SELECT * FROM employees
ORDER BY first_name ASC, last_name DESC; -- DESC is applied to last_name only


-- Example: Order By with expression ( expression LENGTH(x) <ORDER> )
SELECT * FROM employees
ORDER BY LENGTH(last_name) DESC;
